This is an old game of Pong that I wrote. I kind of remember working on it. It used DJGPP to compile and ran under DOS.
It actually uses farpokes to set the video ram to do the drawing. I am not sure if all the code is written by me, but
judging by the huge amount of comments I wrote, I think it is. The code is dated 12/19/02, so I guess I worked on it
around Christmas time. I am putting it here for safe keeping and nostalgia.
